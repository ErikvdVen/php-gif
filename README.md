# php-gif
Below GIF image contains real-time data. A PHP script calculates the pending time till new year and generates the GIF image.
![Live countdown to new year](http://only-media.nl/gif/gif.php)

## TIP
An ideal solution for sending e-mails with real-time data to customers. E-mail clients give you the oportunity to load images by URL and so everytime a client re-opens the mail, it gives realtime data about the current pending time.
