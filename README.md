Below GIF image contains real-time data. A PHP script calculates the pending time till new year and generates the GIF image.
An ideal solution for sending e-mails with real-time data to customers. E-mail clients give you the opportunity to load images by URL and so everytime the client re-opens the e-mail message, the GIF will be re-generated with real-time data.
