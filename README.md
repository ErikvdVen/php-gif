# php-gif
Below GIF image is an example image which can contain real-time data. A PHP script calculates the pending time till new year and generates the GIF image. An ideal solution for sending e-mails with real-time data to customers. E-mail clients give you the opportunity to load images by URL and so everytime the client re-opens the e-mail message, the GIF will be re-generated with real-time data.

For below image this doesn't work, unfortunately, cause github downloads the image and stores it. E-mail clients, however, do load the images directly from source :)
